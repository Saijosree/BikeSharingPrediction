## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are shared by individuals for a price or free.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- BoomBikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.



## Conclusions
- As per the model analysis, temperature is the driving factor for the increase in shared bikes
- Also, year is the another driving factor of shared bikes
- In the given two years given in data set, the shared bikes count increased by 23% from 2018 to 2019
- Weather situation has negative effect on shared bikes count.
- Extreme weather conditions, like rains, thunder storms, can reduce the shared bikes demand by nearly 25%
